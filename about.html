                    <p>Hello! My name is Jack Bowen, and I'm currently studying at the University of Oregon. I plan on graduating in 2027 with a major in accounting and a minor in art. I was born on May 4, 2004, in Dallas, Texas, and I've loved math, creating art, and learning about technology for as long as I can remember- in fact, my earliest memory is of me carefully drawing a picture of my mother while I was in preschool.</p>
                    <p>My early childhood interests have sent me down a long and winding path that eventually made me the passionate and driven person I am today, and I have zero plans to slow down anytime soon. My main hobbies include drawing, graphic design, model kits, and video games, but I also love to read and go to the movies. Additionally, I've become much more interested in web development after taking a class for it at the University of Oregon.</p>
